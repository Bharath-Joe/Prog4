Our TinyFS implementation works well as we were able to implement all of the required features and 
demonstrate that they work properly in our demo video.

For the two areas of additional functionality we chose to implement option B: renaming and listing all 
files/directories on disk, and option e: timestamps for creation, modification, and access times for all 
files. We also demonstrated these additional features in our demo video.
